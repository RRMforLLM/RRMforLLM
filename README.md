# RRMforLLM

A collection of tools, experiments, and systems I’m actively building, maintaining, or dissecting.

This isn’t a portfolio—it’s a working directory. Repos here range from automation frameworks to interface logic to personal infrastructure. Some are solo utilities, others are part of broader frameworks I’m still piecing together.

## 🧠 If there’s a pattern, it’s probably this:

- Build small, composable pieces.
- Automate what’s tedious *but* meaningful.
- Use classification and structure to make systems more understandable, not more complicated.
- If a UI isn’t helping you think or act faster, it’s wasting your time.

## ⚙️ Repo visibility

A lot of what I work on is private while it’s in flux. Public repos are either:
- Final-ish versions of things I use regularly, or
- Open thoughts I’m putting out there in case someone finds them useful.

## 👋 Quick note

This space evolves with what I’m learning. It’s not polished, it’s not branded—it’s just active.  
If you’re building anything related or curious about something here, reach out.
